## Steps to Implement on Replit

1. **Update Database Schema**
   - The schema already includes the new `stepsDetailed` field
   - Run migrations if needed: `npm run db:push`

2. **Update Existing Activities**
   - Option A: Run the update script
     ```bash
     cd server && npx tsx update-activities.ts
     ```
   - Option B: Manually update through seed file
     - The seed.ts already has "Kitchen Music Lab" replacing "Music Composition Basics"
     - Run: `npm run db:seed` to reseed with improved activities

3. **Test the New UI**
   - The ActivityCard component will automatically show "Show me how" buttons for activities with detailed steps
   - Test with the improved activities to see expandable content

## Key Improvements

### Before (Vague Instructions):
- "Learn basic music concepts"
- "Design an engineering challenge"
- "Research a topic"

### After (Concrete Steps with Expandable Details):
- Clear, actionable steps like "Fill glasses with different water levels to make a scale"
- Expandable details with bullet points for each step
- Age-specific variations (5-6 years, 6-7 years, 7-8 years)
- Helpful tips for parents

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify schema migration completed successfully
- [ ] Check that improved activities appear in the app
- [ ] Test "Show me how" button expands/collapses properly
- [ ] Verify detailed instructions, tips, and age variations display correctly
- [ ] Ensure old activities without detailed steps still work (fallback to simple steps)

## Notes

- The UI gracefully handles both old (simple steps) and new (detailed steps) formats
- Progressive disclosure pattern keeps initial view clean while providing depth when needed
- All improvements focus on the 6-7 age range as requested
